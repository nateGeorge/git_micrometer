This is a sweet example post

It uses [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

{% highlight js %}
// Here is a code block
document.addEventListener('event', someFunction);
{% endhighlight %}

#### This is a heading. Yep.

You can have some inline code like `var answer = 42`. And **bold** and _italicize_ and whatnot.
